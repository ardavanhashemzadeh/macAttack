As many times as I've done this, I always forget where things are kept and have to search google again, so here are my notes:

0) Boot into single user mode then create a quarantine folder with subfolders matching the directory tree of items to be quarantined
1) Quarantine suspicious items (why not everything?) in ~/Library/LaunchAgents by moving them into the quarantine folder
  If items cannot be moved try chflags nouchg
2) For each quarantined item, find where it points to and quarantine that
3) Reboot and disable networking before opening browsers to remove extensions and reset home and startup pages
4) Remove suspicous, unused or unrecognized login items
